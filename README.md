# NewsApp
 A news aggregator app project

This was my first 'big' solo project. The app was made as an assessment for my mobile apps module in my third year of university. The project was mainly written in Kotlin with XML used for the UI design elements.
Firebase was used as the backend of the app as it is very accessible and easy to learn. In addition, the app was not intended to be published so a free account made it ideal for this project.
I used https://gnews.io API which is a news aggregator API that has a decent amount of calls for a free account, however, it does not support pagination on a free version so I was unable to implement this as a feature.

Note: The app no longer functions as I have deleted the project from Firebase and removed my API key since I am uploading the project. There is a .mp4 file which is about 6 minutes long that demonstrates the functionality of the app. 

Feel free to look at the source code in /app/src/main/java/com/example/newsapp
